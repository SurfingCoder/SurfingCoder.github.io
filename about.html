            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>I'm a software engineer who currently lives in Florida. I love solving complex problems with well-architected software solutions. It can be incredibly rewarding to craft an intricate design and watch it mature into something great.  I'm passionate about software engineering,  design and management techniques that produce reliable, robust software that is pleasurable to maintain and satisfying to use. Most recently I have enjoyed prototyping and creating new user interface designs and blurring the line between developer and graphic designer.</p>
            <p>Oh, and I love Surfing! It is an incredibly rewarding hobby for many reasons. I spend enough time inside as it is due to my vocation. Surfing is a fun and challenging way for me to get exercise. It also has taken me to many beautiful places around the world. It is also better therapy for the soul than anything else I've come accross so far.</p>
